Transforms cities into civilian militia that defend a territory to avoid capture. While armies or Special Units remain on a territory, cities play no role. But when all armies and Special Units are killed, civilians rise up to defend their land.

Cities built on territories cannot be captured, they must be destroyed before the territory can be captured. 1 city has the strength of 1 army.

Example:
When attacking a territory with 5 units and 2 cities:
(A) attack army of <8 units: reduces the armies, has no effect on the cities, territory is not captured
(B) attack army of 8 units: kills the 5 defending units, cities are unharmed, territory is not captured
(C) attack army of 10 units: kills the 5 defending units, destroys 1 city, 1 city remains, territory is not captured
(C) attack army of >=11 units: kills the 5 defending units, destroys 2 cities, no cities remains, territory is captured
