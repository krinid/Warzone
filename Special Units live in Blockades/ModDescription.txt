When a Custom Special Unit** is killed in an attack, it is captured by the party that killed it and becomes their Special Unit.

**Custom Special Units are created by mods. Examples: tanks, dragons, army recruiters, construction workers, I.S. units, medics, behemoths, phantoms, priests, diplomats, capitalists, etc.

Note that some Special Units can't be killed (eg: Monolith, Shield) so they can never be captured.

NOTE: Commanders die normally, no captures/ownership changes occur.

DURING AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK: (defender keeps their territory)
- When an attacker's Special Unit dies, it is reassigned to the defender and placed on the defender's territory.
- When an defender's Special Unit dies, it is reassigned to the attacker and placed on the attacker's territory.
- It is possible for Special Units belonging to both attacker and defender to die during the attack, and each dead unit will be captured and reassigned to the other player appropriately.

DURING A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK: (attacker captures defender's territory)
- All Special Units killed during the attack become owned by the attacker and are placed on the newly captured territory.
