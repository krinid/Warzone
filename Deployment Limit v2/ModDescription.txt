Limit the number of armies a player can deploy on a single territory each turn. Deployments will be automatically removed during turn entry phase if the limit is exceeded. When the turn advances, if a player's territory exceeds the limit through some means such as getting booted, turned to AI, deployments made via auto-pilot or other mods that can't be blocked during turn entry phase, the armies in excess of the deployment limit will be randomly distributed to other territories, keeping within the deployment limit. If every territory has reached the deployment limit, those armies will be lost.
