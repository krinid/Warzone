As soon as territories have no actual armies or Special Units (eg: Commanders, Tanks, Dragons, Behemoths, Recruiters, etc), they will become neutral. This mechanism takes effect after every order during a given turn.

If you use multi-attack, you could string together thousands of attacks. Use the "Limited Multimoves" mod to prevent this from happening.
