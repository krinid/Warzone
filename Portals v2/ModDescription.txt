At the beginning of the game, Portals are created on the map which connect 2 territories. When more than 1 portal is used, they are numbered to indicate the opposite end of the portal. 

At the end of each turn, the territories on either end of each Portal are swapped. All armies and Special Units will swap to the other side of the portal.
