Adds customization for Bomb Cards whereby damage applied is a combination of:
(A) % damage dealt (0% - 100%)
(B) fixed damage (any integer)

% damage is applied first, then fixed damage is applied

Example: if configured to 25% damage + 10 fixed damage, a target territory with 100 armies would be reduced to 65 (100*0.75-10) after the Bomb  hits

Bombs can also be configured to impact at end of turn instead at start of turn
