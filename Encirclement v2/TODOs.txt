Based on our previous discussion, doesn't sound like you're going to work on Encirclement in the near future? I'm thinking a v2 is in order; adding functionality like:

- include functionality to surround neutrals (which is timely b/c Weaken Blockades has had errors during configuration since the 'accessed a destroyed object' upgrade)
- eliminate orders that don't actually have any effect (actually this is for WB not Encircle -- after neutrals have gone to 0, it continues to add orders each turn to reduce them)
- add configurable functionality to block gifts, airlifts in/out of surrounded territories 
- add 'advanced mode' to encircle (can encircle from a configurable distance)
- configurable varying % reductions based on the surround distance, eg:
	- surrounding from 3 doesn't stop reinforcements but causes loss of 1 unit/turn
	- surrounding from 2 doesn't stop reinforcements but causes loss of 10% units/turn + blocks airlifts
	- direct surround (from 1) stops reinforcements and causes loss of 30% units/turn
- add support for teams (can't encircle teammates)
- configurable if SUs prevent going to neutral or not
