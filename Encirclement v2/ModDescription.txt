ENCIRCLEMENT:
When a player's territory is surrounded on all bordering territories by other players, they can't deploy new armies, and the army counts present are reduced. If the territory reaches 0 armies, it turns neutral.

WEAKEN BLOCKADES:
When a neutral territory is surrounded by a single player, the armies present are reduced. Enabling 'Long Rang Encirclement' permits surrounding neutrals up to a distance of 4 territories away.
