Enable purchasing of Castles from the Commerce menu. Castles allow armies to enter the castle to bolster defense on a given territory.

A territory can only have 1 castle.

Castles have configurable base cost, addition cost increase per castle owned, maintenance cost per turn. A conversation ratio controls how armies scale to castle health. For example the default value of 2 means that when 1 army enters a castle, it adds 2 strength to the castle, which defines both the castle's health and defense power.

Armies can be moved in or out of the castle via the mod menu, and these become orders in the Attack/Transfer phase.

Special Units cannot enter castles.
