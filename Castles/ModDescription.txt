Purchase Castles from the Commerce menu. Armies can enter castles to bolster defense on a given territory. Special Units cannot enter castles. A territory can only have 1 castle.

Castles do not protect armies or Special Units on the territory it resides on. To protect armies, they need to enter the castle.

Castles have configurable base cost, additional cost increase per castle owned and maintenance cost per turn. A conversion ratio controls how armies scale to castle health. Default value of 2 means that when 1 army enters a castle, it adds 2 strength to the castle, which defines both castle's Health and Defense Power.
