Enable purchasing of Castles from the Commerce menu. Armies can enter castles to bolster defense on a given territory.

A territory can only have 1 castle.

Castles have configurable base cost, additional cost increase per castle owned and maintenance cost per turn. A conversion ratio controls how armies scale to castle health. The default value of 2 means that when 1 army enters a castle, it adds 2 strength to the castle, which defines both the castle's health and defense power.

Armies can be moved in or out of the castle via the Commerce menu (the "Build" button below the gold quantity indicator).

Order execution timing:
- Army Entry occurs at the same time Emergency Blockade cards are played. (after Bombs, before Attack/Transfers)
- Army Exit occurs at the same time Blockade cards are played. (after Attack/Transfers)
- Castle Scuttles occur at the same time Blockade cards are played. (after Attack/Transfers)
- Castle Purchases occur at the same time new card pieces are received. (after Attack/Transfers)

Special Units cannot enter castles.

Castles do not protect armies or Special Units on the territory it resides on. To protect armies, they need to enter the castle.
