Each turn a bonus is held, its value increases. Game host can configure min and max bonus values, and the amount the value of the bonus will increase by each turn.

Mechanics:
• Each territory in a bonus has an independent counter that increases each turn it is held
• When a territory changes ownership, its multiplier is reset
• When a bonus is complete, its value is multiplied by the average multiplier of all territories in that bonus
