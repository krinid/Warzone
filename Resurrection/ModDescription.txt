Adds a Resurrection Card to the game.

If you possess a whole card when your Commander dies, you are not eliminated, and you can play this card at the start of the following turn to resurrect your Commander to a territory of your choice.

You don't need to play the card until your Commander dies.

If you fail to play a card on the turn directly after your Commander dies, the mod will choose a territory to resurrect your Commander to.
